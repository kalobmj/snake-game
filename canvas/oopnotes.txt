OOP is Commonly Used In:

    C++ and Java — These languages are very OOP-heavy and encourage building programs with class hierarchies.

    Python — Also supports OOP very cleanly.

    JavaScript — JS wasn’t originally designed with OOP in mind, but modern JS (ES6 and beyond) has solid class support and is great for learning OOP.

Why JS + OOP is a Great Combo for You:

    You’ll practice class-based design like you'd do in Java or C++.

    You’ll learn how to structure programs more cleanly, making it easier to scale your code later.

    It’ll prepare you for college-level CS concepts, since many courses use Java or C++ to teach OOP.

What You’ll Typically Create in Your Snake Game (OOP Style):

Here’s how you might start thinking in terms of classes:

    Snake → Keeps track of position, direction, and handles movement.

    Food → Holds the position and handles respawning.

    Game → Coordinates everything: sets intervals, detects collisions, updates score.

    Maybe Board → Handles drawing things on the canvas or screen.

Each class would have:

    Properties (like this.body, this.position, etc.)

    Methods (like .move(), .draw(), .checkCollision())
